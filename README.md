# LayerMe

Basically turned this meme

![when you see a group of horde coming to gank you so you have your buddy from layer two invite you](https://i.imgur.com/3WiI34O.jpg)

into a handy clickable button on your screen:

Requires other people in your guild to have the addon, but your guild chat is getting spammed with "LAYER ME PLS" already anyway.

Nice meta you got going on there blizz #notmyclassic
